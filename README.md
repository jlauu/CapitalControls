# CapitalControls

This was a 1-week side project done by me and my lab partner for an econ professor. All the commits are his because we didn't bother setting up on another dev machine.

Exploratory interface on capital control dataset, where for each year and each country, a flag for bond, credit, and equity-type assets is true if the country has a trade policy which controls it.
